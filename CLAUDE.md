# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a project scaffold workspace designed for general development. The repository contains a basic folder structure with `src/`, `tests/`, and `docs/` directories, currently empty and ready for development.

## Repository Structure

```
ScaffoldWS/
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md  # GitHub Copilot workflow instructions
├── src/                         # Source code (currently empty)
├── tests/                       # Test files (currently empty)
├── docs/                        # Documentation (currently empty)
├── .gitignore                   # Git ignore rules for Python and Node.js
└── README.md                    # Basic project description
```

## Development Workflow

This repository follows the GitHub Copilot instructions defined in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, which outlines a systematic checklist for project setup:

1. Clarify project requirements (language, frameworks)
2. Scaffold the project structure
3. Customize according to requirements
4. Install required extensions
5. Compile and resolve dependencies
6. Create and run tasks
7. Launch the project
8. Ensure documentation is complete

## Key Guidelines from Copilot Instructions

- Use current directory (`.`) as project root for all operations
- Keep communication concise and focused
- Avoid verbose explanations unless requested
- Only install extensions specified by project setup tools
- For unspecified projects, assume "Hello World" as starting point
- Avoid unnecessary media files or external integrations
- Update progress systematically through checklist items

## Current State

The repository is in its initial scaffold state with:
- Empty source, test, and documentation directories
- Basic .gitignore configured for Python and Node.js projects
- Generic README placeholder text
- GitHub Copilot workflow instructions in place

When working with this repository, determine the project type and requirements first, then follow the systematic workflow defined in the copilot instructions to properly scaffold and set up the development environment.
